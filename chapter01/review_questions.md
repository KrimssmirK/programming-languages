# Chapter 1 Review Questions

1. Why is it useful for a programmer to have some background in language design, even though he or she may never actually design a programming language?

It gives an idea what programming language is better to use in target domain. It will allow us to learn new programming languages quickly because you aware of universal concept of programming language.

2. How can knowledge of programming language characteristics benefit the whole computing community?

Computing community will be wise of utilizing the programming languages based on their pros and cons and community will be quick to develop more advance algorithm.

3. What programming language has dominated scientific computing over the past 50 years?

FORTRAN - It has more floating point arithmetic operations feature.

4. What programming language has dominated business applications over the past 50 years?

COBOL - COmmon Business Oriented Language

5. What programming language has dominated artificial intelligence over the past 50 years?

LISP - Linked List is used commonly to process symbolic computation.

6. In what language is most of UNIX written?

C - Unix is a secure operating system. It works only on commands and scripts along with read, write , and execute permission for each file.

7. What is the disadvantage of having too many features in a language?

It affects the readability of programming language. Extra features can lead to more verbose code, as developers might use additional features even when simpler constructs would suffice. This can make the codebase harder to read and maintain.

8. How can user-defined operator overloading harm the readability of a program?

The intuition of that operator will be destroyed and it is not easy to read code.

9. What is one example of a lack of orthogonality in the design of C?

Incrementing pointers over the primitive types. Adding one to the pointer means add the size of the type of the data not by one and adding one to the primitive types is just adding one and these are inconsistent for same operation that leads to be lack of orthogonality.

10. What language used orthogonality as a primary design criterion?

Ada
